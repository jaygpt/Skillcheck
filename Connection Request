Hello, Jaygpt!!!

I am Deeksha Kulshreshtha. I am pursuing B.tech and currently, I am in my final year. I saw the description of your project on Interview Bit and from there I got your repo 
and research paper. 

I want to implement this project my final year project. I will learn blockchain for this project. But as of now, I am not familiar with blockchain, smart contracts, and all. 

Can you guide me with your project? Which algorithm is working? 
How will this model verify the skill? 

Awiatedly waiting for your reply.
